# Kubernetes Persistent Storage: PV, PVC and Storage Class

### PersistentVolume (PV)

In Kubernetes Persistent Storage a PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage within the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes. PV is an abstraction for the physical storage device (such as NFS or iSCSI communication) that you have attached to the cluster. The main feature of a PV is that it has an independent life cycle which is managed by Kubernetes, and it continues to live when the pods accessing it gets deleted.

A typical YAML file of PV using hostPath PersistentVolume looks like this:
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: task-pv-volume
  labels:
    type: local
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  capacity:
    storage: 10Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```

### PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)

A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. The claim can include specific storage parameters required by the application. For example, an amount of storage, or a specific type of access (RWO – ReadWriteOnce, ROX – ReadOnlyMany, RWX – ReadWriteMany, etc.).

- ReadWriteOnce — the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node

- ReadOnlyMany — the volume can be mounted read-only by many nodes

- ReadWriteMany — the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes

Kubernetes looks for a PV that meets the criteria defined in the user’s PVC, and if there is one, it matches the claim to PV then it binds the PV to that PVC.

A typical YAML file of PVC looks like this:
```yml 
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: task-pv-claim
spec:
  storageClassName: manual
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 3Gi
```

You can attach the storage to a pod by adding a volume section in the pod config file:
```yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: task-pv-pod
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: task-pv-storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: task-pv-claim
  containers:
    - name: task-pv-container
      image: nginx
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: "http-server"
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/usr/share/nginx/html"
          name: task-pv-storage
```

### StorageClass
Storage Class allows the provision of Kubernetes persistent storage dynamically. With a storage class, administrators need not create a persistent volume separately before claiming it. Administrators can define several StorageClasses that give users multiple options for performance. For example, one can be on a fast SSD drive, it also supports Cloud Storage Services like AWS EBS, AzureDisk, GCEPersistentDisk, etc.

A typical YAML file of storage class using AWS EBS storage looks like this:
```yml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: standard
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
  type: gp2
reclaimPolicy: Retain
allowVolumeExpansion: true
mountOptions:
  - debug
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
```

### Persistent Storage – Phase
- Available – A free resource that’s not yet sure to a claim
- Bound – The Volume is bound to a claim
- Released – The claim has been deleted, but the resource isn’t yet reclaimed by the - cluster
- Failed – The volume has failed its automatic reclamation.

### Lifecycle of Volume and Claim
Persistent Volumes are the resources within the cluster. PVCs are requests for those resources and also act as claim checks to the resource. The interaction between PVs and PVCs follows the following lifecycle:

Provisioning
There are two ways PVs could be provisioned: statically or dynamically.

1. Static
In static provisioning of the Kubernetes persistent Storage, the administrator has to make existing storage devices available to a cluster. To make existing storage available to a cluster, the administrator has to manually create a persistent volume after that only user can claim the storage for the pod by creating PVCs.

2. Dynamic
Dynamic provisioning is used when we want to give developers the liberty to provision storage when they need it. This provisioning is based on StorageClasses: the PVC must request a storage class and thus the administrator must have created and configured that storage class for dynamic provisioning to occur. In order to demand storage, you must create a PVC.

### Binding

When a user creates a PVC with a specific amount of storage requested and with certain access modes. The control loop within the master watches newly created PVCs finds an identical PV (if possible), and binds them together. If a PV was dynamically provisioned for a new PVC, the loop will always bind that PV to the PVC.

### Reclaiming

When the user no longer needs a volume, they can delete the PVC. The reclaim policy for a PersistentVolume tells the cluster what to do with the volume after it has been released of its claim. Currently, volumes can either be Retained, Recycled, or Deleted.

### Retain

The Retain reclaim policy allows the manual reclamation of the resource. Deleting the PVCs does not delete PV. it can still exist in the cluster and is considered to be “released”. But it’s not yet available for an additional claim because the previous claimant’s data remains on the volume.

### Delete

The volume plugins support the Delete reclaim policy. Deletion removes both the PV from the K8s cluster as well as the external storage asset like AWS EBS, GCE PD, Azure Disk, or Cinder volume.

### Recycle

Volume plugins that support the Recycle reclaim policy perform a basic scrub on the volume and make it available again for a fresh claim.

Note: The Recycle reclaim policy is outdated. Instead, the recommended approach is to use dynamic provisioning.
