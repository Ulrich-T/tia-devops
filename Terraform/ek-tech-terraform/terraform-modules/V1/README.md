### Bit
* cidrsubnet: it use to calculate subnets
* 8 is the number of bits
* if the numer of bit is 8, we have the below subnets.(255.255.255.0)
```tf
cidr_block = "${cidrsubnet(var.cidr_block, 8, count.index)}"

private_cidrs   = [
      + "10.0.3.0/24",
      + "10.0.4.0/24",
      + "10.0.5.0/24",
    ]

public_cidrs    = [
      + "10.0.0.0/24",
      + "10.0.1.0/24",
      + "10.0.2.0/24",
    ]
```

* if the numer of bit is 4, we have the below subnets.
```tf
cidr_block = "${cidrsubnet(var.cidr_block, 8, count.index)}"

+ private_cidrs   = [
      + "10.0.48.0/20",
      + "10.0.64.0/20",
      + "10.0.80.0/20",
    ]

  + public_cidrs    = [
      + "10.0.0.0/20",
      + "10.0.16.0/20",
      + "10.0.32.0/20",
    ]
```
* if the numer of bit is 10, we have the below subnets.
```tf
cidr_block = "${cidrsubnet(var.cidr_block, 10, count.index)}"
+ private_cidrs   = [
      + "10.0.0.192/26",
      + "10.0.1.0/26",
      + "10.0.1.64/26",
 
  + public_cidrs    = [
      + "10.0.0.0/26",
      + "10.0.0.64/26",
      + "10.0.0.128/26",
    ]
```
### Connect on the private from bastion 
* Store the in s3 
* Download it into a bastion and change the permission
```t
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/linuxtraining.tk/bastion-key.pem
chmod 400 bastion-key.pem
ssh -i "bastion-key.pem" ec2-user@10.0.5.205
```
### Test on the private subnet
```
yum update -y
yum install -y tree
ping -c5 www.google.com
```

### RDS
* Put the DB on the public subnet so the you can test the connection


### from_port and to_port values for icmp protocol ingress rule aws_security_group resource? 
- [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65673015/from-port-and-to-port-values-for-icmp-protocol-ingress-rule-aws-security-group-r)
- and [here](https://earlruby.org/2021/08/allow-ping-from-specific-subnets-to-aws-ec2-instances-using-terraform/)

Assuming you want to allow a ping to your server you can use the following terraform configuration 
```
from_port = 8
to_port = 0
protocol = "icmp"
```


```t
resource "aws_instance" "my-test-instance" {
  count                  = 2
  ami                    = "${data.aws_ami.centos.id}"
  instance_type          = "${var.instance_type}"
  key_name               = "${var.key_name.id}"
  vpc_security_group_ids = ["${var.security_group}"]
  // this will create 2 instance in 2 different subnet us-west-2a and us-west-2b. we use the element function to do that.
  subnet_id              = "${element(var.subnets, count.index )}"
  user_data              = "${data.template_file.init.rendered}"

  tags = {
    Name = "my-instance-${count.index + 1}"
  }
}

resource "aws_ebs_volume" "my-test-ebs" {
  count             = 2
  availability_zone = "${data.aws_availability_zones.available.names[count.index]}"
  size              = 1
  type              = "gp2"
}
```

* name: The name of the database to create when the DB instance is created.
* username: Username for the master DB user.
* password: Password for the master DB user
* db_subnet_group_name:  DB instance will be created in the VPC associated with the DB subnet group. If unspecified, will be created in the default VPC
* vpc_security_group_ids: List of VPC security groups to associate.
* allows_major_version_upgrade: Indicates that major version upgrades are allowed. Changing this parameter does not result in an outage and the change is asynchronously applied as soon as possible.
* auto_minor_version_upgrade:Indicates that minor engine upgrades will be applied automatically to the DB instance during the maintenance window. Defaults to true.
* backup_retention_period: The days to retain backups for. Must be between 0 and 35. When creating a Read Replica the value must be greater than 0
* backup_window:The daily time range (in UTC) during which automated backups are created if they are enabled. Must not overlap with maintenance_window

* multi_az: Specifies if the RDS instance is multi-AZ
* skip_final_snapshot: Determines whether a final DB snapshot is created before the DB instance is deleted. If true is specified, no DBSnapshot is created. If false is specified, a DB snapshot is created before the DB instance is deleted, using the value from final_snapshot_identifier. Default is false
